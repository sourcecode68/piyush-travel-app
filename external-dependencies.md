# 🧩 External Dependencies and `noExternal` in Vite

## 1. What Are External Dependencies?

When Vite (or Rollup) **bundles** your code, it decides which modules to:
- **Bundle** → include the actual code inside the final build.
- **Externalize** → leave out of the bundle and load separately from `node_modules` or a CDN at runtime.

An **external dependency** is any package that is **not bundled** — instead, it is imported dynamically when the app runs.

### Example:
```js
import React from "react";
```
In SSR mode, Vite might not include React inside the bundle — it expects Node to load it from `node_modules`.  
That makes React an **external dependency**.

## 2. Why Vite Externalizes Dependencies in SSR

In **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** builds, code runs in Node.js, which can easily load packages directly from `node_modules`.  
Externalizing:
- Reduces bundle size.
- Speeds up build times.
- Avoids bundling libraries that Node can already resolve.

However — some packages **don’t work correctly** when externalized.

## 3. What `noExternal` Does

The `noExternal` option inside the `ssr` config tells Vite:

> “Do **not** treat these dependencies as external — **bundle** them into the SSR output instead.”

### Example:
```js
ssr: {
  noExternal: [/@syncfusion/]
}
```
This means:
- All packages starting with `@syncfusion/` will be **included directly** in the server bundle.
- Useful when a package uses ESM-only syntax, dynamic imports, or browser-like behavior that fails when externalized.

## 4. Comparison Table

| Behavior | Externalized | Bundled (`noExternal`) |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------|
| Loaded from | `node_modules` at runtime | Included directly in SSR bundle |
| Build size | Smaller | Slightly larger |
| Works with problematic libraries | ❌ Sometimes fails | ✅ Always works |
| Controlled by | Default Vite behavior | `ssr.noExternal` config |

---

## 5. Typical Use Case

You usually add libraries to `noExternal` when:
- They cause errors during SSR (e.g. “Cannot use import statement outside a module”).
- They rely on browser APIs or modern module syntax.
- They’re UI libraries like `@syncfusion`, `@mui`, `three.js`, etc.

---

✅ **In short:**
> - **External dependency** = not bundled, loaded from outside (`node_modules`) during SSR.  
> - **`noExternal`** = force Vite to bundle specific packages into the SSR build to ensure compatibility.
